A simple 3d printed volume/media controller macropad with 3 MX-style keyswitches and 8 customizable WS2812B RGB LEDs! Runs on [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).

Case is still a WIP. Current version requires drilling holes into the top housing for the screws. The USB cutout also seems a bit off but that could just be poor tolerances from my 3d printer.
